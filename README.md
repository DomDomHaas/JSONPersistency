# JSONPersistency
Easy way to save and load the data of GameObjects in Unity3D

This asset gives the possiblity to save any kind of GameState data into a file.
There is the possiblity to connect a file directly with an Monobehaviour and keep it persistent in a JSONFile.

This version is in a bit an undocumented state, that's soon to change.
